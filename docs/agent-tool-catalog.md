# Curated Agent Tool Catalog

HAI uses [e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents) and [OSS Insight Collections](https://ossinsight.io/collections) as discovery sources, not installation sources. A ranking or awesome-list is not a security review, a stable API contract, or permission to run third-party code on Robert's device.

## Operating rule

- The catalog is read-only at `GET /api/v1/brain-catalog/`.
- Listing a project never downloads, installs, enables, or executes it.
- The back-office **Start review** action creates a normal, owner-scoped HAI pursuit with the catalog provenance and adapter-review gates; it does not activate the project.
- OSS Insight discovery scans every repository row returned for HAI's eligible categories (currently 33 candidate or represented categories). It labels the upstream result as a ranked collection response, never as an exhaustive GitHub inventory; the public endpoint currently returns a fixed 20-row list and does not honor ordinary paging parameters.
- An owner-admin can run `POST /api/v1/brain-catalog/:id/revalidate` to retrieve bounded public GitHub metadata for one fixed catalog entry. The recheck never fetches source code or changes an adoption decision.
- The optional local SearXNG profile is a discovery adapter, not an answer engine. `GET /api/v1/research/status` shows its configuration, admin-only `POST /api/v1/research/probe` checks only its configured local `/healthz` endpoint, and `POST /api/v1/research/search` returns bounded, unverified source candidates only when the owner has enabled a local endpoint. The probe does not validate JSON output, engine policy, external-source behavior, provenance, or evidence quality.
- The optional local RAGFlow bridge is a fixed-dataset candidate-evidence adapter, not HAI memory or an agent runtime. `GET /api/v1/ragflow/status` reports non-secret configuration, `POST /api/v1/ragflow/probe` checks endpoint and reported dependency health, and `POST /api/v1/ragflow/retrieve` can query only configured local dataset IDs and returns only chunks with stable provenance IDs. **Grounded Answers** presents returned chunks only as manually selectable, unverified evidence; it cannot ingest, delete, call an agent/MCP/code-executor, or update HAI state automatically.
- The optional local AnythingLLM bridge is a fixed-workspace candidate-evidence adapter, not HAI memory, chat, or an agent runtime. `GET /api/v1/anythingllm/status` exposes non-secret configuration, `POST /api/v1/anythingllm/probe` checks only authenticated access to the fixed workspaces, and `POST /api/v1/anythingllm/retrieve` calls only the upstream workspace vector-search endpoint. It cannot chat, send attachments, read history, ingest/delete documents, change workspace settings, or trigger tools. Retrieval remains disabled until the operator explicitly confirms that the configured workspace embeddings are local.
- The optional CloudQuery source adapter consumes only a fixed, local, operator-produced JSONL sync summary. It never runs CloudQuery or reads CloudQuery credentials, configuration, plugin data, raw source data, or destination data. HAI accepts completed newline-terminated rows under a read-only mounted folder, keeps a bounded incremental cursor, and routes the resulting health summaries through normal provenance, review, workflow, and deletion controls.
- The optional OpenSpec source adapter is a selected-folder, read-only planning-artifact reader. It groups only active `openspec/changes` proposal, design, task, and specification Markdown into one source-linked bundle per change. It skips archived changes and all code outside that tree; it never installs/runs OpenSpec, writes files, commits, creates branches/pull requests, or authorizes execution.
- Task planning can recommend a project capability, but does not select it as an executable tool.
- A project becomes executable only after a dedicated adapter has been reviewed, configured, health-checked, and routed through HAI's existing approval and audit controls.
- HAI remains the policy owner: an external framework cannot bypass the local-first policy, paid budget, source controls, folder allowlist, emergency stop, or approval queue.

### whisper.cpp local transcription

The opt-in `local-transcription` Compose profile builds one pinned local
`whisper.cpp` runner. It is disabled unless `HAI_WHISPER_CPP_ENABLED=true`, the
runner profile is started, and a reviewed GGML model is manually placed under
`./whisper-models`. HAI does not download a model or start a microphone.

Create an owner-scoped `whisper-audio` connected source with `localOnly: true`
and an explicit subfolder of `./connected-sources`, for example
`voice-notes/2026-07`. `POST /api/v1/sources/:id/transcribe` accepts no body:
it can inspect only that registered subfolder, with its model, language, file,
size, and timeout limits set by the local operator. The internal runner mounts
the intake and model folders read-only, has no published host port, no network
attachment beyond its internal bridge, and returns text plus bounded model
metadata only. HAI turns that text into normal, owner-scoped, uncertain source
extractions with `audio://` provenance. Existing source correction, archive,
deletion, audit, workflow, and approval paths then apply.

This is not ambient recording, audio uploading, speech-driven action execution,
or evidence verification. A transcript may be wrong; it must be reviewed
against the original audio before it supports a consequential claim or action.

## Curation snapshot: 2026-07-20

| Project | HAI disposition | Intended role | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) | Candidate | Source-controlled coding checks and review | Active Apache-2.0 project with a focused review/CI surface. Requires a check-only adapter before HAI uses it. |
| [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) | Candidate | Review-first interactive coding assistance | Active Apache-2.0 LLM-devtool. Any HAI bridge needs a confined workspace, explicit model provider, tool/network allowlists, and approval before write-capable work. |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) | Candidate | Review-first terminal coding assistance | Active MIT MCP-client/terminal project. Any HAI bridge needs a confined workspace, explicit model provider, tool/network allowlists, and approval before write-capable work. |
| [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) | Candidate | Isolated development-agent runtime | Active project, but workspace and tool access are high-risk. It requires a local container, workspace/network allowlists, and an approval-gated adapter. |
| [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed no-tool local planning draft | The private `crewai-planning` profile receives one short task plus bounded criteria and returns one schema-checked review artifact. It has no HAI tools, sources, memory, persistence, approval, or execution authority. |
| [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) | Candidate | Review-first coding assistance | Available Apache-2.0 coding tool. Any write-capable use needs a confined workspace and explicit approval. |
| [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) | Reference only | External sandbox design | Its hosted execution model is not local-first and can involve external credentials/billing. Disabled unless separately approved. |
| [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) | License review | Workflow platform reference | The repository is active but includes differently licensed areas. HAI does not vendor or integrate it until a per-directory license review is complete. |
| [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) | Compatibility only | Existing AutoGen workload migration, structured agent-event translation, and guarded MCP compatibility | The official project is maintenance mode. HAI does not install or execute AutoGen code, and a reviewed bridge plus approval is required. |
| [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed no-tool local planning draft | The private `agent-framework-planning` profile uses two fixed roles and one reviewed local model. HAI retains provider maintenance, policy, routing, approval, audit, verification, and completion ownership. |
| [MetaGPT](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/MetaGPT) | Excluded | Architecture reference only | Still available, but its release and substantive push activity were older than the active candidates at curation time. |
| [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | Integrated profile | Keyed loopback provider-gateway normalization | Requires explicit enablement, a local endpoint, model alias, virtual key, probe, and manual generation approval; HAI's EUR 0 policy remains authoritative. |
| [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) | Integrated profile | Local semantic retrieval inside HAI Postgres | Opt-in `vector` extension plus local embeddings for source extraction and HAI's editable context memory. Source and memory ownership remain separate authorities; keyword retrieval remains the truthful fallback. |
| [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal) | Integrated, opt-in | Durable governed follow-up checks | Local-only service plus one narrow Go worker. It creates HAI proposals only; HAI retains all approval and completion gates. |
| [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) | Integrated profile | Token-protected HTTP metrics export | Opt-in exporter with no raw-data labels; a local collector remains separately configured. |
| [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) | Reference only | Optional advanced metrics visualization | Deferred until real Prometheus metrics justify a second dashboard. |
| [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) | Integrated profile | Local-only pre-activation MCP inspection | HAI performs only a bounded Streamable HTTP handshake and tool inventory for configured local endpoints; it never spawns a process or calls a tool. |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) | Integrated, opt-in | Local GGUF model inference | Loopback-only model server through HAI's existing local-provider, provenance, live-probe, and approval policy. |
| [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) | Integrated, opt-in | Read-only local browser verification | Named allowlisted local routes only; no clicks, forms, downloads, retained state, public origins, sending, publishing, purchasing, or account changes. |
| [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) | Integrated, opt-in | Local public-source discovery | Operator-hosted local JSON endpoint only. HAI uses bounded queries and returns source candidates, never fetches result pages or accepts snippets as verified facts. AGPL-3.0 requires a separate license and deployment review. |
| [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) | Integrated, opt-in | Bounded local WASI helper runtime | Reviewed modules only, with no inherited network and explicit resource/capability limits; every run remains approval-gated. |
| [OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) | Integrated profile | Internal deterministic CP-SAT schedule proposals | Opt-in `optimization` Compose profile accepts bounded opaque jobs and returns an audited proposal only; it has no workflow, calendar, filesystem, tool, or external-network apply endpoint. |
| [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) | Integrated, opt-in | Read-only business-system source ingestion | One operator-owned Odoo JSON-2 endpoint, API key, optional database, and fixed model allowlist only. HAI calls only bounded `search_read`, preserves source links and cursors, and cannot write, invoke generic RPC methods, or expose the key. |
| [ShareT](https://github.com/Robert-Velhorst/004-ShareT) | Integrated, opt-in | Read-only ShareT link inventory | One operator-owned ShareT origin and scoped `connector:read` token only. HAI verifies read capability, follows every pagination page within an explicit completeness limit, preserves public-link provenance, excludes participant email addresses and secrets, and has no ShareT write path. |
| [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) | Integrated, opt-in | Local CloudQuery sync-summary intake | HAI reads only a fixed, operator-produced local `cloudquery sync --summary-location` JSONL file. It never starts CloudQuery, accesses its credentials/configuration, or receives raw source/destination data. Rows become bounded provenance-linked sync-health signals, not facts or execution authority. |
| [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) | Integrated, opt-in | Local spec-driven planning artifact intake | HAI reads only active `openspec/changes` Markdown under an explicitly selected local project folder, grouping proposal/design/tasks/specs into a reviewable source bundle. It never invokes OpenSpec, reads repository code outside those files, writes changes, or authorizes coding execution. |
| [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) | Reference only | Retrieval and tool-orchestration patterns | HAI will not add a parallel agent stack without a documented gap. |
| [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) | Reference only | Connected-source and retrieval patterns | Deferred while HAI's native extraction, search, and pgvector path mature. |
| [Cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) | Reference only | Evidence-graph and entity-linking patterns | Deferred until a graph-query need, provenance model, and retention plan are proven. |
| [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) | Reference only | Future dedicated vector-store option | Deferred to avoid a second vector store before pgvector has a measured limit. |
| [Activepieces](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces) | Reference only | Connector and workflow-pattern reference | Do not introduce a competing workflow, secrets, or approval control plane by default. |
| [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | Reference only | Memory-consolidation reference | HAI remains the sole personal-memory and provenance authority. |
| [OpenMetadata](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata) | Reference only | Source-governance reference | Defer its independent metadata control plane until an enterprise-scale gap is measured. |
| [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) | License review | Workflow-platform comparison | Sustainable Use License restrictions and workflow overlap require an explicit decision. |
| [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) | Excluded | Object-storage reference | Archived upstream and AGPLv3 are outside HAI's adoption bar. |

## Newly reviewed capability candidates

The following candidates were reviewed against their public upstream records.
They appear in HAI's Brain Catalog, capability matcher, and adoption roadmap;
none is installed, configured, or executable through HAI.

| Project | HAI disposition | Intended role | Hard boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) | Integrated, opt-in | Internal offline quality report over synthetic/redacted fixtures | The optional `evaluation` profile runs a bounded local Evidently DataSummary report. HAI rejects detected PII/secrets before sending, returns metadata only, and cannot export fixture text, call providers, verify completion, alter routing/policy, or trigger actions. |
| [Whylogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) | Reference only | Compact data-quality profiling and constraint patterns | It is not installed or connected: its latest public package release is from 2024, it overlaps HAI's report-only Evidently bridge, and its documented anonymous analytics default would need disabling. Any future review must retain profiles locally and prevent data export, memory updates, routing changes, verification claims, or action authorization. |
| [Guardrails AI](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed-schema action-proposal validation | The optional `validation` profile accepts one bounded redacted JSON proposal, returns metadata only, and cannot invoke a model, fetch Hub validators, store data, approve, or execute. |
| [PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) | Integrated, opt-in | Local schema-validated planning draft | The optional `typed-planning` profile pins `pydantic-ai-slim[openai]` 2.13.0 and accepts only a short task request plus success criteria for one operator-reviewed loopback model. It has no tools, MCP, web, file, source, memory, persistence, retries, provider selection, approval, or execution authority. The result remains a HAI-validated draft. |
| [A2A Protocol](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) | Integrated, opt-in | Local authenticated planning interoperability | HAI exposes a disabled-by-default A2A 1.0-shaped Agent Card and a narrow `SendMessage` JSON-RPC profile for one named local bearer-token peer. It requires `A2A-Version: 1.0`, accepts only standalone `ROLE_USER` text with a `messageId`, and returns one bounded non-executable proposal artifact. It is not a full A2A task-lifecycle server: task persistence/polling, source refresh, approval, execution, peer discovery, streaming, file input, memory/source disclosure, and tool invocation are unavailable. |
| [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) | Integrated, opt-in | Authenticated local read-only HAI MCP bridge | The optional `mcp-bridge` profile pins FastMCP 3.4.4 and exposes only workflow aggregate and bounded actionable-summary tools to one local bearer-token client. It uses a second bridge token to read one configured owner's HAI state, binds to loopback only, and has no task, approval, execution, source, memory, policy, filesystem, process, or secret-returning tool. |
| [ChatGPT/Codex Conversation History MCP](https://github.com/oogxdd/chatgpt-codex-mcp-daemon) | Integrated, opt-in | Model-directed bounded conversation-history context | HAI connects only to an operator-managed local Streamable HTTP endpoint. During generation the model may choose among nine statically reviewed read-only tools; HAI validates every call, permits at most six calls, caps each result at 12,000 characters and aggregate MCP context at 48,000 characters. Results retain endpoint/tool provenance and remain untrusted. HAI never starts the daemon, invokes unreviewed/future tools, or grants retrieved text execution authority. |
| [Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed synthetic local safety regression | The optional `safety-evaluation` profile runs a shipped six-case local prompt-injection and high-risk-action suite against one configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Its health probe requires that model and suite configuration, the runner clears inherited proxy variables and runs unprivileged, and it returns aggregate pass/fail metadata only. It cannot accept real prompts, sources, models, providers, endpoints, commands, or alter HAI decisions. |
| [garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed synthetic local prompt-injection regression | The optional `garak-evaluation` profile pins garak 0.15.1 and runs one four-case `PromptInject` probe against one configured local OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The runner clears inherited provider credentials and proxy variables, accepts no caller-selected target/model/probe/input, deletes raw JSONL/hit/HTML reports, and returns aggregate metadata only. It cannot target HAI, connected sources, accounts, runtimes, or actions, and the result cannot change HAI decisions. |
| [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) | Integrated, opt-in | Fixed synthetic source-grounding regression | The optional `deepeval-evaluation` profile pins DeepEval 4.1.1 and evaluates only three shipped synthetic evidence/answer pairs with `FaithfulnessMetric` through one configured local OpenAI-compatible judge. It returns aggregate evaluator accuracy only; no real HAI answer, source, prompt, model output, metric reason, routing, verification, policy, memory, workflow, approval, or action is accessible. |
| [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) | Integrated, opt-in | Local aggregate control-plane observability | The local-only bridge checks self-hosted health and readiness, then an owner can explicitly export one fixed OTLP/HTTP JSON span containing only static aggregate control-plane metadata. It cannot export prompts, source text, workflow records, model data, tokens, files, or caller-selected content; traces cannot change HAI decisions. |
| [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents) | Candidate | Explicitly opt-in real-time voice and multimodal intake | No microphone, call, MCP tool, or external contact is activated without session consent, configured local/self-hosted service, and HAI approval. |
| [mistral.rs](https://github.com/ericlbuehler/mistral.rs) | Integrated, opt-in | Loopback OpenAI-compatible local model serving and multimodal evaluation | HAI has an operator-configured, loopback-only `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` provider profile with live probing and the existing EUR 0 router. The upstream's UI, agent, shell, web, file, MCP, Skills, and code tools are not integrated. |
| [AG2](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2) | Compatibility only | Existing AG2 / AutoGen-era workload migration and pattern review | It cannot become a second agent control plane. Any bridge must use a fixed schema and HAI-owned model policy, audit, approvals, workspace limits, and tool allowlist. |
| [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) | Integrated, opt-in | Complex document parsing, evidence-linked retrieval, and reranking | HAI has a disabled-by-default, local-only retrieval bridge with an explicit dataset allowlist. It remains an external retrieval index, not HAI memory or truth; its optional agent/code executor is disabled and any deployment first needs a measured gap, source allowlist, resource budget, provenance, and deletion review. |
| [Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) | Integrated, opt-in | Approved-workspace source and connection inventory | HAI's local-only `airbyte-inventory` connector reads a fixed one-page list of source and connection metadata from allowlisted workspaces. It excludes credentials, connector configuration, selected fields, records, sync results, and all mutation or sync-control actions. |
| [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) | Integrated, opt-in | Local workspace vector-search evidence retrieval | HAI has a disabled-by-default local bridge to the documented vector-search endpoint for fixed workspace slugs. It requires local-embedding confirmation and never calls AnythingLLM chat, history, attachments, agents, tools, or mutation APIs. Returned chunks remain manually selected, unverified evidence. |
| [Presidio](https://github.com/data-privacy-stack/presidio) | Integrated, opt-in | Local PII detection second-pass | The maintained project moved from the Microsoft GitHub namespace. HAI has a disabled-by-default local Analyzer bridge with fixed language/entity allowlists and bounded metadata-only results; it cannot anonymize, persist, replay, delete, or prove content safe. HAI's deterministic privacy controls remain authoritative for known secrets. |
| [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) | Integrated, opt-in | Read-only semantic repository context | HAI exposes a disabled loopback-only bridge for one self-started project-pinned Serena endpoint. It calls only `find_symbol` with source bodies and hover data disabled, returns bounded symbol metadata, and never starts Serena, changes projects, or exposes shell, file, editing, memory, diagnostic, or generic MCP tools. |
| [Microsoft UFO](https://github.com/microsoft/UFO) | Reference only | Windows and multi-device execution architecture | It exposes GUI, UIA, Win32, WinCOM, and cross-device agent capabilities. HAI will not connect it to a Windows session, screen, device, provider, or tool surface without a separate execution-safety design. |
| [Goose](https://github.com/aaif-goose/goose) | Reference only | General-purpose local-agent and MCP interoperability patterns | Its historic `block/goose` slug now redirects here. Its desktop, CLI, API, provider, extension, and execution surfaces would create a second control plane, so it is not embedded, installed, or run by HAI. |
| [SWE-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent) | Reference only | Superseded coding-agent architecture | Its own upstream now recommends mini-SWE-agent. HAI will not add a legacy code-worker, repository mount, provider credential, or agent loop from SWE-agent. |
| [mini-SWE-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent) | Integrated, opt-in | Disposable patch proposal | The private `patch-proposals` profile uses one read-only allowlisted snapshot and isolated Ollama model, copies input to a temporary workspace, and returns a bounded complete diff for review. It cannot apply, commit, push, open a pull request, access the host shell/Docker socket/accounts, or retain generated source. |
| [OpenCode (opencode-ai legacy)](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | Excluded | Archived same-name terminal agent | This is a distinct archived project, not an alias for HAI's active `anomalyco/opencode` candidate. It cannot inherit that profile's review status or receive a workspace, model provider, MCP server, credential, or runtime adapter. |
| [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) | Excluded | Unmaintained public sandbox upstream | The public repository states that core development moved private in June 2026. HAI must not install, connect, or recommend it as a runtime, sandbox, account integration, or execution adapter. |

### RAGFlow capacity gate

RAGFlow's own self-hosting guidance calls for at least 4 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM,
50 GB disk, Docker Compose, and gVisor when its optional code executor is
used. Its standard Compose HTTP service uses port `80`; operators must map it
to a dedicated port that does not collide with HAI before setting the bridge
base URL. HAI does not provision it automatically. The implemented retrieval
bridge is disabled until `HAI_RAGFLOW_ENABLED`, its API key, and at least one approved
dataset ID are configured. A local deployment review must
record its resource reservation, document folder/connector allowlist, model and
embedding endpoint, retention/deletion/export rules, and proof that its code
executor is disabled before the HAI adapter review can begin.

The API includes the source URL, verification date, activation requirements, safety disposition, and task recommendation rationale for every entry. This lets the frontend show the difference between a capable project, a configured integration, and an executable runtime.

## AutoGen compatibility profile

AutoGen is not HAI's execution foundation and is never selected for generic
coding or autonomous work. Its compatibility profile is limited to existing
AutoGen assets that need a controlled migration or interoperability plan.

The profile translates useful documented patterns into HAI-owned controls:

| AutoGen pattern | HAI control | Hard boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event-driven agent messages | Task events, workflow state, and audit records | HAI owns lifecycle and completion decisions. |
| Agent teams and delegation | Planner recommendations and approval-gated assignments | No upstream agent can self-authorize an action. |
| MCP Workbench | Trusted-only runtime registry with tool, folder, and network allowlists | A reviewed adapter and risk gate are required. |
| Code execution | Controlled runtime executor | The catalog exposes no generic executor. |

This is deliberately a protocol and control mapping, not an AutoGen SDK
integration. The upstream project warns that MCP servers must be trusted
because they may execute commands or expose sensitive data; HAI keeps that
boundary explicit.

## Microsoft Agent Framework candidate

Microsoft now positions Agent Framework as AutoGen's successor. HAI records it
as a candidate for a future local, fixed-schema orchestration bridge, not as a
second control plane. Its useful patterns are checkpointing, human-in-the-loop
workflow steps, provider-neutral middleware, and A2A/MCP interoperability.

Any activation must be locally hosted, name explicit peers and allowed tools,
emit HAI-owned audit events, and hand every protected action back to HAI's
approval and verification layers. Cloud Foundry hosting, credential discovery,
framework-owned provider routing, and automatic peer/tool discovery are out of
scope for this profile.

## Next adapter work

1. Continue: a read-only check adapter that can report findings into HAI verification without repository writes.
2. OpenHands: a locally containerized adapter with per-workspace and per-network allowlists plus a durable stop handle.
3. CrewAI: an operator-hosted, local-model service adapter with a narrow task schema; HAI continues to own approvals and execution.
4. Aider: a review-first adapter that produces a patch proposal and validation evidence before any write is permitted.
5. SearXNG: an operator-managed local source-discovery endpoint. The built-in adapter is ready, but is disabled until its local instance, JSON format, search-engine policy, and AGPL deployment are explicitly reviewed.

Do not add a generic `run arbitrary agent` endpoint. That would collapse the safety boundary this catalog exists to preserve.

## MCP preflight profile

The built-in preflight mirrors the useful review stage of MCP Inspector without
embedding its broad proxy/process-launch capability. Enable it only for a
reviewed local Streamable HTTP server:

```dotenv
HAI_MCP_PREFLIGHT_ENABLED=true
HAI_MCP_PREFLIGHT_SERVERS=local-docs@mcp-inspector=http://host.docker.internal:3001/mcp
HAI_MCP_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
```

For a self-started Serena HTTP server, `HAI_SERENA_ENABLED=true`,
`HAI_SERENA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:9121/mcp`, and a stable
non-path `HAI_SERENA_PROJECT_ID` expose `GET /api/v1/serena/status`, an
owner-admin `POST /api/v1/serena/probe`, and owner `POST /api/v1/serena/symbols`.
The probe performs only the MCP handshake and `tools/list`; symbol lookup calls
only the reviewed `find_symbol` tool with source-body and hover data disabled.
HAI does not install or start Serena, activate/mount a repository, supply
credentials, or expose any other Serena tool.

`GET /api/v1/mcp-preflight/overview` reports configuration and the most recent
operator check. `POST /api/v1/mcp-preflight/local-docs/run` is admin-only and
performs `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, and `tools/list`. It
requires each endpoint to name an eligible reviewed Brain Catalog MCP profile,
then accepts only `localhost`, loopback IPs, and `host.docker.internal`; rejects
URL credentials, query strings, external hosts, redirects, response bodies
over 1 MiB, non-JSON responses, unexpected response IDs, and protocol-version
downgrades. It returns a bounded tool name inventory only. It does not execute
a listed tool, retain schemas/descriptions, expose headers, accept bearer
tokens, or enable an HAI runtime.

## ChatGPT/Codex conversation-history context

`chatgpt-codex-mcp-daemon` ships a local stdio server, while the containerized
HAI backend accepts only an operator-managed local Streamable HTTP endpoint.
Expose the already-built helper without giving HAI process-launch authority:

```powershell
npx -y supergateway `
  --stdio 'C:\absolute\path\to\hist.exe mcp' `
  --outputTransport streamableHttp `
  --stateful `
  --protocolVersion 2025-06-18 `
  --port 8099 `
  --streamableHttpPath /mcp
```

Then opt in through `.env.local`:

```dotenv
HAI_CHATGPT_LOGS_MCP_ENABLED=true
HAI_CHATGPT_LOGS_MCP_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8099/mcp
HAI_CHATGPT_LOGS_MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=8
HAI_MCP_PREFLIGHT_ENABLED=true
HAI_MCP_PREFLIGHT_SERVERS=chatgpt-logs@chatgpt-codex-mcp-daemon=http://host.docker.internal:8099/mcp
```

Planning performs no speculative history lookup. During generation, a
provider-neutral JSON decision loop lets the selected model either answer or
request one of these reviewed read-only tools: `list_sources`,
`list_conversations`, `search`, `get_conversation`, `get_context`,
`get_message`, `get_raw`, `sync_status`, and `stats`. This supports discovery,
follow-up retrieval, original-message provenance, and corpus-completeness
checks without requiring provider-specific function-calling support.

HAI, not the model, enforces the boundary: every tool name and argument is
allowlisted and normalized, each result is capped at 12,000 characters, a task
may make at most six calls across eight model rounds, and aggregate MCP context
is capped at 48,000 characters. Tool results are persisted with call traces and
endpoint/tool provenance, fed back to the model as untrusted data, and supplied
to normal grounding and verification. HAI never starts the daemon, follows
instructions found in retrieved text, invokes a future advertised tool, writes
to the corpus, or treats MCP data as execution authority.

## OR-Tools planning profile

The optional `optimization` Compose profile runs a private OR-Tools CP-SAT
service without a host port. HAI exposes the following owner-scoped routes:

- `GET /api/v1/planning-optimizer/status`
- `POST /api/v1/planning-optimizer/probe` (admin-only, read-only health check)
- `GET /api/v1/planning-optimizer/runs`
- `POST /api/v1/planning-optimizer/proposals`

The proposal request accepts at most 100 opaque IDs plus bounded integer minute
windows, durations, priorities, and optional fixed starts. HAI rejects remote
solver URLs, redirects, URL credentials, query strings, oversized request and
response bodies, unknown solver statuses, unexpected job IDs, altered
durations/priorities/windows, overlapping output, and incomplete job
accounting. It persists only the request digest and bounded proposal result.
No route applies a proposal to a workflow, task, calendar, source, file, tool,
or external account.

## Temporal durability profile

The optional `durability` Compose profile provisions a private local Temporal
server and separate PostgreSQL volume. HAI's only registered Temporal workflow
is an owner-scoped due-open-loop check that calls the existing HAI proposal
service. Its payload carries an opaque HAI run ID rather than owner identity or
source content. It cannot invoke a connector, runtime, browser, script, or
external action, and it does not alter HAI approval or completion state.

The owner-scoped routes are `GET /api/v1/temporal/status`,
`GET /api/v1/temporal/follow-up-runs`, admin-only
`POST /api/v1/temporal/worker/start`, and approval-gated
`POST /api/v1/temporal/follow-up-runs`. See
[Temporal durability](temporal-durability.md) for the full controls.

## OSS Insight curation scope

OSS Insight currently indexes more than one hundred repository collections.
HAI reviewed the collections that map to its real control planes: AI agent
frameworks, AI gateways, MCP clients, GraphRAG, vector stores, workflow
schedulers, LLM developer tools, and monitoring. The resulting entries are
recorded in the authenticated read-only API together with their exact source
collection. This is a curation snapshot, not a claim that all repositories in
the database are suitable, installed, or safe to run.

The full 102-collection screen and its per-category disposition are maintained
in [the OSS Insight screening ledger](ossinsight-screening-ledger.md).
